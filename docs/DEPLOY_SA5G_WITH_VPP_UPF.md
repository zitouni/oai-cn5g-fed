In previous tutorial we have used oai-spgwu-tiny UPF. Moreover in this utorial we are going to integrate oai 5g core with opensource VPP-UPF by [Travelping](https://www.travelping.com/). VPP based UPF uses vector packet processing and it is has proven very good performance in the user plane. Motivation for this integration to test and validate high performance VPP-UPF in with oai 5G core.

##### About VPP-UPG -
UPG implements a GTP-U user plane based on 3GPP TS 23.214
and 3GPP TS 29.244 Release 15. It is implemented as an
out-of-tree plugin for [Fdio VPP](https://github.com/FDio/vpp). The possible uses for UPG are:
* User Plane Function (UPF) in 5G networks
* Packet Data Network Gateway User plane (PGW-U)
* Traffic Detection Function User plane (TDF-U)

Project is available on github as VPP-UPG which follows release 16 of 3GPP specification TS 29.244. More details about VPP-UPG can be found on [official page](https://github.com/travelping/upg-vpp). VPP-UPG currently doesn't support NRF feature hence and it also uses optional IE called network instance (nwi) to uniquely identify interfaces of UPF in the form of domain name. Hence we use branch nwi from smf to handle this optional element for the moment.

Let's begin !!
* Steps 1 to 4 are similar as previous tutorial on [DsTest](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/oai-cn5g-fed/-/blob/146e5d5925acdc9633b91ac3198c8cdeec3ef34f/docs/DEPLOY_SA5G_WITH_DS_TESTER.md). Please follow these steps to deploy OAI 5G core network components.
* We depoloy gnbsim docker service on same host as of core network, so there is no need to create additional route as we did for dsTest-host.

## 5. Deploying OAI 5g Core Network ##
* We will use same wrapper script for docker-compose that used for previous tutorials to set up 5gcn with VPP-UPF. Use help option to check how to use this wrapper script.
* Note:- Here we have additional option to select UPF version between OAI-UPF (openair-spgwu-tiny) and 3rd party UPF (vpp-upf).

```bash
 oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose$ ./core-network.sh -h

Only use the following options

start [option1] [option2]: start the 5gCN
stop [option1] [option2]: stops the 5gCN

--option1
nrf: nrf should be used
no-nrf: nrf should not be used

--option2
vpp-upf: vpp-upf should be used (only works without nrf, no-nrf option1)
spgwu : spgwu should be used as upf (works with or without nrf, nrf or no-nrf option1)

Example 1 : ./core-network.sh start nrf spgwu
Example 2: ./core-network.sh start no-nrf vpp-upf
Example 1 : ./core-network.sh stop nrf spgwu
Example 2: ./core-network.sh stop no-nrf vpp-upf

```

Please make a note that VPP-UPF doesnt support NRF feature, hence we deply 5gcn with no-nrf.
```bash
oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose$ ./core-network.sh start no-nrf vpp-upf

We can verify status of all components by docker command also -
```bash
oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                         PORTS                          NAMES

```
## 6. Configuring gnbsim Scenario ##
* Build gnbsim docker image
```bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/kharade/gnbsim.git
$ cd gnbsim
$ docker build --tag gnbsim:develop --target gnbsim --file docker/Dockerfile.ubuntu.18.04 .
```

## 7. Executing the gnbsim Scenario ##
* The configuration parameters, are preconfigured in [docker-compose.yaml](../docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) and [docker-compose-gnbsim.yaml](../docker-compose/docker-compose-gnbsim.yaml) and one can modify it for test.
* Launch gnbsim docker service
```bash
oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-gnbsim.yaml up -d gnbsim-vpp

Creating gnbsim ... done
```
* After launching gnbsim-vpp, make sure all services status are healthy -
```bash
oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                         PORTS                          NAMES

```
## 8. Traffic Test ##
* Ping test <br/>
Here we ping UE from external DN container.
```bash
$ docker exec -it oai-ext-dn ping -c 3 12.1.1.2

Last thing is to remove all services - <br/>

* Undeploy the gnbsim
```bash
/oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-gnbsim.yaml down
Stopping service gnbsim ...
Stopping gnbsim ... done
Removing gnbsim ... done
Network demo-oai-public-net is external, skipping
